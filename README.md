# Project background
Flask Banking is a web app and can be found here: http://www.joshba.co.uk/accounts/1

The app simulates a basic bank account with banking features, such as managing bank accounts (add/update/delete) and creating new transactions or transfers to sub-accounts. Furthermore, transactions
can be filtered by various properties and exporting as CSV file.
The main <strong>focus</strong> of this project was not to create a feature-rich web app but to <strong>learn Python Flask</strong>(transferring skills from Ruby on Rails), ORM via SQLAlechemy with a strong focus on 
learning to write <strong>extensive tests (Pytest) and to build and document an API.</strong>
